=head1 NAME

Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother - Base module for smoothing statistical data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother;
  my $smoother = Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother->instantiate({
           method   => 'exponential',
           coeff    => 0.5,
           data     => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
           samples  => [110, 120, 130, 140, 150],
    });
  my @smoothed_data = $smoother->get_smoothed_data();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provide methods to smooth the trend of a series of statistical data.

The methods provided are the C<Exponential> and the C<Weighted Exponential> (see respectively
C<Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother::Exponential> and C<Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother::Weightedexponential>
for more details).

This class is just a factory that will instantiate the object to perform the
chosen smoothing algorithm.

=head1 METHODS

=over 5

=item Statistics::Descriptive::Smoother->instantiate({});

Create a new Smoother object.

This method require several parameters:

=over 5

=item method

Method used for the smoothing. Allowed values are: C<exponential> and C<weightedexponential>

=item coeff

Smoothing coefficient. It needs to be in the [0;1] range, otherwise undef will be reutrned.
C<0> means that the series is not smoothed at all, while C<1> the series is universally equal to the initial unsmoothed value.

=item data

Array ref with the data of the series. At least 2 values are needed to smooth the series, undef is returned otherwise.

=item samples

Array ref with the samples each data value has been built with. This is an optional parameter since it is not used by all the
smoothing algorithm.

=back

=item $smoother->get_smoothing_coeff();

Returns the smoothing coefficient.

=item $smoother->set_smoothing_coeff(0.5);

Set the smoothing coefficient value. It needs to be in the [0;1] range, otherwise undef will be reutrned.
